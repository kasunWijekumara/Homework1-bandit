Here we can use cat command to read the file.

Level 1 - 2

First I used the cat Command as the previous one. It didn't work. So I use ./ before it to convince that the - is the acctual file name because it is a bash.

Level 2 - 3

Here the file name had spaces. So I had to put a backslash infront of everyspace

Level 3 - 4

Even though this inhere file shows that it is empty from ls command by using ls -la command we can see there is a hidden file

Level 4- 5

https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/18352388/14390033/c09f7edc-fdd2-11e5-83cc-72a0b37964c7.png

Here we can use file command. From that we can see there is onely one file with human readable ASCII text. So in there we can find the password

Level 5 - 6

In here we can use find command. So by that we can the find the file using the given attributes.

Level 6 - 7

Here also we can use find command with given attributes. Instead of finding in the home directory as previously here we have to find the password in file somewhere in the sever. We can get a large number of files matching to those attributes. But from them we can see clearly one contain the password

Level 7 - 8

We can just use the cat command and read the whole file and pick the word next to the word millionth. But it will be very hard and time consuming. So we can use grep command allong with cat command.

Level 8 - 9

https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/18352388/14390041/c100a90a-fdd2-11e5-9600-5a4aa86e2d07.png

Here also we can use just the cat command. But here also we can see a aspecial specification. The password is on a line that is not repeated. So we can use uniq command with the sort command

Level 9 - 10

Here we can use the grep command as previous. But with strings command not with cat command.

Level 10 - 11

As this file is encided with base64 we have to decode it using base64
